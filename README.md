# Autopilot

![Autopilot](https://github.com/sitepilot/autopilot/workflows/run-tests/badge.svg)

Autopilot is a (cloud) webhosting control panel for managing multiple servers, sites and WordPress installations. We use Autopilot at [Sitepilot](https://sitepilot.io) for our managed WordPress webhosting platform. With Autopilot you can:

* Provision WordPress optimized web servers and load balancers.
* Monitor server and site health of the provisioned servers and sites.
* Manage and maintain WordPress sites.

Autopilot is build on top of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to provision servers, users, databases and sites on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS servers.

## Supported Server Providers

Autopilot supports the following server providers:

* [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com/signup/?promo=HGMAN9)

If your preferred provider is not baked into Autopilot, you can always use the Custom VPS option. There are a few requirements to ensure that this works successfully:

* The server your connecting to must be running a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
* Your server must be accessible by the Autopilot host.
* There must be a root user with no password.
